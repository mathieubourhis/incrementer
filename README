My Aim : 
--------
What I wanna do is a game.
An incrementer game. 
In short, a point and clickety clickety click. 
I have a lot of trouble finding another one of these games online (except for Coockie Clicker / Candy Box), so why not making one.


Chapter 1.
----------
* intro
Let's write some basics.

* 1.0
First I wan't some data. Some thing i may manipulate.  A Concept to be incremented.
Why not several resources. I'll start with one. (Fallout's bottle caps :p I'll rename later :p)

* 1.1. 
My resource may be incremented, so i'll have an amount by witch it'll be incremented.
I'll also have the quantity i currently has, and some container.

* 1.2. 
I'll need to ad some basic gaming main.. for science..

* 1.3.
I'll need to be able to update the increment value. With some levels on the bottlecaps. That's what i want in games :p building levels.
In fact, a ressource shouldn't be able to know how to increment itself. 
It should be dependent on formulas based on buildings levels incrementing one or several resource.
(Several this may increment one resource)

* 1.4.
I'll add annother building for testing 

Chapter 2.
----------
* intro
Let's introduce other resources.

* 2.0
I actually can't find any other fun resource with the bottlecaps so i'll stick to basics.
I'm actually thinks about a viable way to keep this an incrementer game with multiple resources.
Each resource has to be clickable, and the player has to choose which one he want's to boost. 
I'll use wood and metal at first, i'll see later if i find something else.
I'll change the Buildings accordinly too.

* 2.1
A building costs resources, which are decremented from the total acquired.

* 2.2
I'll need to consider this game a web app at some point. I'll try "wicket", and add maven support and several cool tools.

* 2.3
I need to be able to see this as a client side ajax thread and see the actual incrementing on screen.
OMG wicket is wicked !

* 2.4
I'll add some visual content and provide a manual mode, not always automatic mode.

Chapter 3.
----------
* intro
Ok, i have somethine really cool now, and what Wicket provides is OVER 9000 ! 
I'll smooth up the visual a bit, add the +1 ressource mechanics and adjust the formulas.

 * 3.0
 I need to have separated ressources amounts, not juste a massive toString one the biggest container.
 
 * 3.1 
 I have an idea where i want to go from here. I need another resource for it, food. I'll come back to visuals later.

Issues
- Weird thing, the loss of precision for doubles is quite troubling for outputs. Tried with BigDecimals, and was worse.. I formatted, but its heavy for performances / memory, especially for a game like this.
