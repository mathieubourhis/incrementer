My Aim : 
--------
What I wanna do is a game.
An incrementer game. 
In short, a point and clickety clickety click. 
I have a lot of trouble finding another one of these games online (except for Coockie Clicker / Candy Box), so why not making one.


Chapter 1.
----------
* intro
Let's write some basics.

* 1.0
First I wan't some data. Some thing i may manipulate.  A Concept to be incremented.
Why not several resources. I'll start with one. (Fallout's bottle caps :p I'll rename later :p)

* 1.1. 
My resource may be incremented, so i'll have an amount by witch it'll be incremented.
I'll also have the quantity i currently has, and some container.

* 1.2. 
I'll need to ad some basic gaming main.. for science..

* 1.3.
I'll need to be able to update the increment value. With some levels on the bottlecaps. That's what i want in games :p building levels.
In fact, a ressource shouldn't be able to know how to increment itself. 
It should be dependent on formulas based on buildings levels incrementing one or several resource.
(Several this may increment one resource)

* 1.4.
I'll add annother building for testing 

Chapter 2.
----------
* intro
Let's introduce other resources.

* 2.0
I actually can't find any other fun resource with the bottlecaps so i'll stick to basics.
I'm actually thinks about a viable way to keep this an incrementer game with multiple resources.
Each resource has to be clickable, and the player has to choose which one he want's to boost. 
I'll use wood and metal at first, i'll see later if i find something else.
I'll change the Buildings accordinly too.

* 2.1
A building costs resources, which are decremented from the total acquired.

Issues
- Weird thing, the loss of precision for doubles is quite troubling for outputs. Tried with BigDecimals, and was worse.. I formatted, but its heavy for performances / memory, especially for a game like this.
