My Aim : 
--------
What I wanna do is a game.
An incrementer game. 
In short, a point and clickety clickety click. 
I have a lot of trouble finding another one of these games online (except for Coockie Clicker / Candy Box), so why not making one.


Chapter 1.
----------
* intro.
First I wan't some data. Some thing i may manipulate.  A Concept to be incremented.
Why not several resources. I'll start with one. (Fallout's bottle caps :p I'll rename later :p)

* 1.1. 
My resource may be incremented, so i'll have an amount by witch it'll be incremented.
I'll also have the quantity i currently has, and some container.

* 1.2. 
I'll need to ad some basic gaming main.. for science..

* 1.3.
I'll need to be able to update the increment value. With some levels on the bottlecaps. That's what i want in games :p building levels.
In fact, a ressource shouldn't be able to know how to increment itself. 
It should be dependent on formulas based on buildings levels incrementing one or several resource.
(Several this may increment one resource)

* 1.4.
I'll add annother building for testing 


Issues
- Weird thing, the loss of precision for doubles is quite troubling for outputs. Tried with BigDecimals, and was worse.. I formatted, but its heavy for performances / memory, especially for a game like this.
