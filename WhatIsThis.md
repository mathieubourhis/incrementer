An incrementer game, but mainly a point-and-clickety-click-a-click-a-cl....

Basically a work in progress, but the aim is

**From a gameplay standpoint :**
  * to have an incrementer game
  * a fun and addictive game
  * where the player handles multiple resources
  * to spend those resources for more resource / second
  * to infinity and beyond

**From a technical standpoint :**
  * to have a browser game
  * which can keep on working offline
  * where the progress can be kept for later
  * with a smooth look :p

**From an educational standpoint :**
  * to learn about most of the techs I use.
  * to be sure the cake is a lie.

I was searching for another browser game to kill some hours (days?), a game as fun as ProgressQuest, CandyBox or CookieClicker.

There is not.

Let's do one.. For science !
